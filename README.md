# Stratyfy React coding exercise

## Introduction

Attached is data representing annual sales at an ice cream parlor.  Please download the data and set up a React project to display it.

We don't want to take up very much of your time; if you find yourself done pretty quickly, that's intentional!

## Specification

Please make a page with the following.

* Two selects with the labels **Flavor** and **Toppings**
* A table with columns labeled **Flavor**, **Toppings**, and **Sales**

Desired behaviors:

* The "Flavor" select should allow you to select nothing, or one of the flavors present in the data, and likewise with "Toppings".
* The rows of the table should contain the provided data.
* There should be an additional row at the bottom labeled **Total** containing the total sales.
* If a flavor and/or topping is selected, all rows matching **either** the flavor **or** topping should be highlighted, e.g. with a different color.

Your result should be readable, **but you need not spend time making it very attractive**.  We are primarily interested in your implementation rather than careful CSS tuning.

Your code **should not depend on the exact contents of this data**.  You can of course assume the form of the data -- i.e., a moderately sized array of objects, with these fields having these types -- but, for example, you should not assume these particular flavors are the ones available.

When you're happy with your work, please share it with us, e.g. by sharing a GitHub repo.

## Interview

Obviously, the initial implementation of a piece of code is only a small fraction of its life; as such, we are interested in your ability to adapt to changing requirements, like all coders face in the real world.

Please come to your interview with your code loaded in an environment where you are comfortable changing it and viewing the results, and be prepared to share your screen.
